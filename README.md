# Tkinter GUI Project

Welcome to the Tkinter GUI Project! This repository contains a collection of modular Tkinter functions and examples, demonstrating how to build various GUI components with Python's Tkinter library.

## Overview

This project showcases small, standalone Tkinter functions, each focusing on a specific widget or feature. The modular approach allows for easy integration and reuse in different projects.

## Features

- **Modular Functions**: Each script demonstrates a particular Tkinter widget or functionality.
- **Variety of Widgets**: Includes buttons, labels, entry fields, menus, and more.
- **Event Handling**: Illustrates how to handle user interactions and events.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Lightweight and Easy to Use**: No additional dependencies beyond Python and Tkinter.

## Repository Structure

- **`menubutton.py`**: Shows how to create and configure a button with an event handler.
- **`scrollbar.py`**: Demonstrates how to add and customize labels.
- **`scale.py`**: Provides an example of using entry fields for user input.
- **`image.py`**: Illustrates how to create a basic menu bar with dropdown options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python **: Ensure you have Python installed.
- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with Python, so no additional installation is needed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pranaychandrikapure/Tkinter.git
    cd Tkinter
    ```

2. Run any script to see its functionality:
    ```bash
    python button_example.py
    ```

### Usage

- Each script in this repository is a standalone example of Tkinter functionality.
- To explore how a specific widget or feature works, simply run the corresponding script.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the provided examples:

- **Appearance**: Modify colors, fonts, sizes, or widget positions.
- **Functionality**: Extend the examples to include additional features or combine them into more complex applications.
- **Integration**: Use the modular functions as building blocks for larger Tkinter projects.
